This can be written signatures of people who saw the agreement take place.In Scripture, oaths are a common form of making promises. They emphasize the promise that is being made. Ruth swears she won't leave Naomi to show how strongly she feels about staying with her (RUT 1:17). Another form of promise in scripture is called a covenant. These were made between governments of two countries, where one country was stronger than the other. The weaker country usually agreed to be a vassal or subject to the stronger nation and pay them tribute. The stronger nation promised to help if the weaker nation got in a war with some other nation. The agreement between the countries was written down, listing all the responsibilities of each side.

Blessing meant abundant provision of goods and children (DEU 7:13). When women got married they are often blessed by others who ask God for many children for them.

References to clothing in Scripture include: garments, fine clothes, expensive clothes, as well as many references to particular items: tunic, robe, cloak, belt, sandals.Although clothing is first of all an everyday item, it carries a significant load of meaning for humans in all cultures. People use clothing for both practical and symbolic purposes. For example, A Christian priest wears a special collar to indicate his position and role in society. Clothing can indicate status or which group a person belongs to.Three types of usage regarding clothing in Scripture are:<ul><li>Literal: There are terms for specific items and types of clothing, their use, manufacture and repair, used descriptively without figurative or symbolic intent. When the angel tells Peter in prison to put on his cloak and sandals, it means just that. It is not figurative or symbolic.</li><li>Figurative: There are clothing terms used figuratively or metaphorically. The Bible’s figurative language may turn out to work well in a receptor language, even though the hearers initially perceive it as odd or unconventional. For example, the expression “you are clothed with splendour” in Psalm 104 requires an initial leap of imagination to make sense.</li><li>Symbolic: There are clothing terms used to stand for larger truths or meanings. They may use such features as colors, the actions of putting on, taking off, and changing clothes, and the symbolic opposition, clothed vs. naked. Clothing is used symbolically in themes running from Genesis to Revelation, from the skin garments of Adam and Eve to the white robes of the saints.</li></ul></div><div class="section-title"><a href="cancel:OCM 290"></a><b>Application to biblical source</b></div><div class="section-content active"><p class="scrtext filter-accepted"><span class="verseref"><a href="goto:RUT 3:1-5|OCM 290">RUT 3:1-5</a></span><span class="commentary">Washing and putting on perfume was done before celebrations, such as marriage ceremonies or at the end of a mourning period for a dead relative (EZE 16:8-10; 2SA 12:20).

In Victorian England many couples never called each other by their first names, but only as Mr. or Mrs. First names were reserved for sibling and parents, or very close friends. Ideas about family can include who eats together with whom, who controls the finances, who makes the decisions for the whole family or for individual family members, who is seen in public, and many other family behaviors. There can be fictive family member, people not related by blood or marriage but who are treated like family. There can also be legal or formal adoption of people not related into the familyOften there are special relationships between certain family members.

High status means they have a lot of influence as well. They may have different status and prestige in different social groups. Status can be ascribed: someone’s importance is based on what family or group a person belongs to, such as a caste system. Or status can be achieved: people gain status by what they accomplish, in business, in education, etc., or in contributions to the community, in hospitality or generosity. Others recognize what they have done or how they have served the community.Status usually has symbols associated with it to show what the status is. These symbols include clothing, jewelry, decorations, documents, means of transportations, such as a priest’s neckband, a coat of arms, diplomas, limousines.Some kinds of status are permanent, other kinds are temporary.

Clocks mark the passing of minutes and hours, calendars mark the passing of months and years. Events that happen are used to mark the passing of time. For agricultural societies, events like planning and harvest are very important. For industrial societies weekends are important. Units of time may differ between cultures. Weeks, months and years may vary in length. The Islamic year uses 12 lunar months, while the west uses solar years of 12 months. The year starts at different times for different cultures. Chinese New Year comes two months after the wester New Year.Time can be viewed as a cycle that keeps repeating itself, or as a line with a beginning and ending. Some cultures look at time starting with today and looking to the past, emphasizing what has happened before. Others look at time from the present into the future, focusing on what will happen rather than what has happened. Other cultures live in the present, with past and future as insignificant compared to today.Hebrew culture viewed time as linear, with the beginning at creation (GEN 1:1) and ending with God’s kingdom coming and his judgement of the world (REV 10:11-13). Sabbath started the week and was the most important day of the week.As an agricultural society, time was marked in Scripture by agricultural festivals. They were also religious festivals since they involved worshipping God.
