            <p>Information dissemination happens both orally and in written form. It can have different levels of
                certainty, such as eye-witness knowledge, second-hand but reliable information, hearsay, story.
                Disseminating information about people in different levels of society may happen in different ways.

                <span class="commentary">Luke's word here for “account” was used for a *narrative of many events, as
                    distinct from a narrative of a single event, and was most characteristically (though certainly not
                    only) applied to works of history. Writers compiling a work usually started with one main source and
                    wove in secondary material from another source or sources. (Most scholars agree that Luke begins
                    with Mark as his main source and weaves in other material, including “Q”). IVP Bacrground Commentary

                <span class="commentary">In Luke's day the more sophisticated writers would often introduce their books
                    with a piece of stylish prose written in the classical style. (Those with literary pretensions
                    generally imitated the Greek of a much earlier period than was commonly spoken.) Luke's introduction
                    here is superb in this regard. IVP Background Commentary

                <span class="commentary">“Handed down” was sometimes a technical term in the ancient world. *Disciples
                    of *rabbis normally passed down first-generation traditions carefully. Oral storytellers were also
                    adept at memorizing and passing on stories accurately. Because Luke writes while eyewitnesses are
                    still alive, and because they were accorded a place of prominence in the early *church, we may be
                    sure that his traditions are reliable. (Eyewitness sources were accepted as the best.) IVP

                <span class="commentary">Literary introductions often specified the purpose of the work (e.g., in
                    *Josephus's Against Apion: “to teach all who wish to know the truth” about the Jewish people); here
                    Luke wishes to provide “exact information” (“exact truth”—NASB; “certainty” —NIV). It was proper for
                    a good historian to check the data that had come to him. Books would often open with a dedication to
                    the wealthy *patron who sponsored the writing project. (Luke-Acts is not just a private work; Luke's
                    Gospel is within 3 percent of the length of Acts, both fitting the standard size of scroll for
                    publication.) Theophilus, the name of the sponsor, was a common Jewish name. “Most excellent” could
                    literally mark him as a member of a high class in Roman society (the equestrian order), although
                    Luke may use the title only as a courtesy. Theophilus's desire for verification was reasonable in
                    view of the many competing claims to religious truth in the Roman Empire. IVP Background Commentary

                    common one-room houses. Most blocks in Capernaum consisted of four homes facing a common courtyard.
                    Villages were also often close together, though one could find a place alone if one arose early
                    enough (most people arose at dawn). IVP Background Commentary

            <p>Certain numbers can have symbolic and other important meaning in cultures. There are many uses of numbers
                and measure in Scripture. Translating numbers without knowing their significance can miscommunicate the
                meaning, or lessen the impact of a Scripture passage. Scripture Use can be enhanced through appropriate
                use of numbering of Scripture products and their presentation. Knowledge of which numbers are good or
                bad can prevent miscommunication with the people around you.
            </p>
            <p>Look for recurring special numbers or counting patterns in oral tradition material such as stories,
                legends and folk tales; music and songs; the way people interpret dreams; material culture arrangements;
                games and gaming. Find out the symbolic significance of often repeated numbers.

            <p>The agricultural cycle is one way a society organizes its activities throughout the year. It involves the

                families grow their own food, buy and barter for food grown by others, or do both, the agricultural
                cycle plays a key role in the formation of any society and its culture.

                    technically could not prosecute him successfully, due to the variety of Palestinian Jewish views on

            <p>Burial, or cremation funeral practices vary from culture to culture. They are important riturals for
                families and communities. Because they often contain prescribed practices of things the family should
                do, they are times of intense family and social pressure. They are also times of crisis and transition
                and as such require family and / or comunity cooperation to honor and care for the desceased.

                <span class="commentary">Interrupting a funeral was a blatant breach of Jewish law and custom; touching
                    the bier exposed Jesus to a day's uncleanness (Num 19:21-22); touching the corpse exposed him to a
                    week's uncleanness (cf. Num 5:2-3; 19:11-20). But in Jesus' case, the influence goes in the other
                    direction. (from IVP Biblical Background Commentary NT)

                    Jesus would meet her first. Philosophers often tried to console the bereaved by saying, “Do not
                    grieve, for it will do no good.” Jesus' approach is entirely different: he removes the cause of
                    bereavement (1 Kings 17:17-24).v(from IVP Biblical Background Commentary NT)

                    custom did not use a closed coffin), Jesus would contract corpse-uncleanness, the severest form of
                    ritual impurity in Judaism. Only those closest to the deceased were expected to expose themselves to
                    this impurity. The young man had not been dead long, because it was necessary to wash, anoint, wrap,
                    mourn over and then bury the body as quickly as possible to avoid the stench of decomposition.(from

                    supernatural knowledge. Jesus uses his supernatural knowledge to identify with the woman who had
                    touched him—even though in the eyes of the public this would mean that he had contracted ritual
                    uncleanness. Lest anyone be permitted to think that the healing had been accomplished by typical
                    pagan magic, operating without Jesus' knowledge, he declares that it happened in response to “faith”

                    period, the week immediately following the death. The initial burial took place shortly after a
                    person's decease, and would have already occurred by the time this man would be speaking with Jesus.
                    But a year after the first burial, after the flesh had rotted off the bones, the son would return to
                    rebury the bones in a special box in a slot in the tomb wall. Thus the son here could be asking for
                    as much as a year's delay. One of an eldest son's most important responsibilities was his father's
                    burial. Jesus' demand that the son place Jesus above this responsibility would thus sound like
                    heresy: in Jewish tradition, honoring father and mother was one of the greatest commandments, and to
                    follow Jesus in such a radical way would seem to break this commandment. IVP Biblical Background

                    could mean that he was deprived of decent burial; but in the *parable it especially points to the

                    Every person, no matter how poor, was to receive a burial, and not to be buried was seen as terrible
                    (e.g., 1 Kings 14:13). But Lazarus, having neither relatives nor charitable *patron, did not receive
                    one, whereas the rich man would have received great eulogies. True Israelites and especially martyrs
                    were expected to share with Abraham in the world to come. The most honored seat in a banquet would
                    be nearest the host, reclining in such a way that one's head was near his bosom. IVP Background

            </p>
            <p>The easiest way to research burial / creamation funeral practices in your area is create a case study.
                Start building the case study by attended a funeral and then asking someone in the community to tell you
                a story about a death in the community, or about a funeral that they attended. Ask them:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Who all is involved in the process?</li>
                <li>What happens to the body?</li>
                <li>What are the responsibilities of the deceased family? What do they do?</li>
                <li>How long does all of this take? What is the timeline of the event?</li>
                <li>What actions show respect / disrespect toward the deceased (and his family)</li>
                <li>What locations are important in the story?</li>
                <li>Are there any differences between a poor and rich man's funeral?</li>
                <li>What are the important things in the story? What are their roles?</li>

            <p>The weather is often a source of ideas and beliefs (especially about cause and effect). A group of people

                    forces of nature, but these were nearly always gods or, less commonly, heroes of the distant past.
                    In Jewish tradition, the one who ruled the winds and sea was God himself (Ps 107:29), though a few
                    pious men were reputed to be able to persuade him to send rain. The surprise of the *disciples at
                    Jesus' power is thus easy to understand. Storms often rose suddenly on the lake called the Sea of
                    Galilee; these fishermen had usually stayed closer to Capernaum and are unprepared for a squall this
                    far from shore. The only place one could sleep in a small fishing boat with water pouring in from a
                    storm would be on the elevated stern, where one could use the wooden or leather-covered helmsman's
                    seat, or a pillow sometimes kept under that seat, as a cushion to rest one's head.

                <bold>Clothing</bold>
            </p>
            <p>
                <bold>Description</bold>
            </p>
            <p>Clothing involes the garmets and materials used to cover the body for utility, warmth and
                ornamentation.
            </p>
            <p>There are many general references in Scripture to clothing: garments, fine clothes, expensive clothes, as
                well as many references to particular items: tunic, robe, cloak, belt, sandals.
            </p>
            <p>Although clothing is first of all an everyday functional item of material culture, it carries a
                significant load of meaning for humans in all cultures, and so also in Scripture, where there are many,
                many references to clothing. Three types of usage regarding clothing in Scripture are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Literal: There are terms for specific items and types of clothing, their use, manufacture and
                    repair, used descriptively without figurative or symbolic intent. When the angel tells Peter in
                    prison to put on his cloak and sandals, it means just that. It is not figurative or symbolic.
                </li>
                <li>Figurative: There are clothing terms used figuratively or metaphorically. The Bible’s figurative
                    language may turn out to work well in a receptor language, even though the hearers initially
                    perceive it as odd or unconventional. For example, the expression “you are clothed with splendour”
                    in Psalm 104 requires an inititial leap of imagination to make sense.
                </li>
                <li>Symbolic: There are clothing terms used to stand for larger truths or meanings. They may use such
                    features as colors, the actions of putting on, taking off, and changing clothes, and the symbolic
                    opposition, clothed vs. naked. Clothing is used symbolically in themes running from Genesis to
                    Revelation, from the skin garments of Adam and Eve to the white robes of the saints.
                </li>

                    shrunk from washing. Wine could be kept in either jars or wineskins; wineskins, unlike jars, would
                    stretch. Old wineskins had already been stretched to capacity by wine fermenting within them; if
                    they were then filled with unfermented wine, it would likewise expand, and the old wineskins,
                    already stretched to the limit, would break. Watered-down wine was drunk with meals. IVP Bible

            <p>Study background information on clothing; also think about clothing in your own culture. The use of
                clothing in some form, even the bare minimum, is an important human universal. Find material on these
                topics
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>People use clothing for both practical and symbolic purposes. For example, A Christian priest wears
                    a special collar to indicate his position and role in society. It is not just to keep his neck warm.
                </li>
                <li>They use it for warmth, for protection, to show modesty, ethnic identity, social status, or a
                    spiritual condition. Men in the west wear 3 piece suits to indicate their seriousness as
                    professionals. On the other hand, Information Technology professionals often wear jeans to show
                    their profession. Many Muslim women wear a head covering for modesty as well as protection from
                    harassment by men in public places.
                </li>
                <li>People may also choose their clothing in order to signal a break with their cultural traditions or
                    social conventions. For example, some immigrants choose to wear the clothing styles of their adopted
                    country rather than maintain their traditional clothing.
                </li>
                <li>Many culture-origin myths include accounts of how people came to wear clothing. What does Genesis
                    say? What are some other accounts of the origin of clothing?
                </li>
                <li>Language related to clothing can reflect all these factors and have sociolinguistic implications as
                    well.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note and record:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>what items people wear</li>
                <li>men, women, boys, girls, adults, children, infants,</li>
                <li>what people of different statuses and roles wear</li>
                <li>elders, widows, richer/poorer, leaders, outsiders</li>
                <li>what people wear at life cycle changes/ceremonies, such as</li>
                <li>weddings, funerals, baptisms, initiations</li>
                <li>manufacture and care of clothes</li>

                    worldwide empire. Particularly in celebration of his birthday (pagans publicly celebrated deities'

                    bristled at (and perhaps responded violently to) the implicit comparison. “Signs” are common in

                    52:9; 66:13). The “*Holy Spirit” was especially associated with *prophecy. On living to see God's

                    advisers may view it as a political statement, especially given the political cost of Herod's
                    illicit liaison with Herodias (see comment on Mk 6:17-20). Herod's nemesis, a Nabatean king, also
                    found ethnic allies in Herod's subject territory of Perea, and Herod may have viewed John's
                    preaching in that region (Jn 3:23) as especially damaging. In ancient Israel prophets normally
                    enjoyed an immunity from persecution that was virtually unparalleled in the ancient Near East
                    (prophets of other nations rarely denounced living kings; at most they suggested more funds for
                    their temples). But some Israelite rulers did imprison (1 Kings 22:26-27; Jer 37—38) and seek to
                    kill or silence them (1 Kings 13:4; 18:13; 19:2; 2 Kings 1:9; 6:31; 2 Chron 24:21; Jer 18:18, 23;
                    26:11, 20-23). John's costly stand prefigures Jesus' death at the hands of the authorities.

                    is supposed to be fulfilled in the messianic era, and the inhabitants of Nazareth saw neither
                    *Messiah nor messianic era before them. Because they lived only four miles from Sepphoris, they were
