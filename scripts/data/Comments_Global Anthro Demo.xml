            </p>
            <p>Information dissemination happens both orally and in written form. It can have different levels of certainty, such as eye-witness knowledge, second-hand but reliable information, hearsay, story. Disseminating information about people in different levels of society may happen in different ways.</p>

            <p class="scrtext">
                <span>LUK 1:1-1</span>
                <span>Luke's word here for “account” was used for a *narrative of many events, as distinct from a narrative of a single event, and was most characteristically (though certainly not only) applied to works of history. Writers compiling a work usually started with one main source and wove in secondary material from another source or sources. (Most scholars agree that Luke begins with Mark as his main source and weaves in other material, including “Q”). IVP Bacrground Commentary</span>
            </p>
            <p class="scrtext">
                <span>LUK 1:1-4</span>
                <span>In Luke's day the more sophisticated writers would often introduce their books with a piece of stylish prose written in the classical style. (Those with literary pretensions generally imitated the Greek of a much earlier period than was commonly spoken.) Luke's introduction here is superb in this regard. IVP Background Commentary</span>
            </p>
            <p class="scrtext">
                <span>LUK 1:2-2</span>
                <span>“Handed down” was sometimes a technical term in the ancient world. *Disciples of *rabbis normally passed down first-generation traditions carefully. Oral storytellers were also adept at memorizing and passing on stories accurately. Because Luke writes while eyewitnesses are still alive, and because they were accorded a place of prominence in the early *church, we may be sure that his traditions are reliable. (Eyewitness sources were accepted as the best.) IVP Background Commentary</span>
            </p>
            <p class="scrtext">
                <span>LUK 1:3-4</span>
                <span>Literary introductions often specified the purpose of the work (e.g., in *Josephus's Against Apion: “to teach all who wish to know the truth” about the Jewish people); here Luke wishes to provide “exact information” (“exact truth”—NASB; “certainty” —NIV). It was proper for a good historian to check the data that had come to him. Books would often open with a dedication to the wealthy *patron who sponsored the writing project. (Luke-Acts is not just a private work; Luke's Gospel is within 3 percent of the length of Acts, both fitting the standard size of scroll for publication.) Theophilus, the name of the sponsor, was a common Jewish name. “Most excellent” could literally mark him as a member of a high class in Roman society (the equestrian order), although Luke may use the title only as a courtesy. Theophilus's desire for verification was reasonable in view of the many competing claims to religious truth in the Roman Empire. IVP Background Commentary</span>

                <span>LUK 4:14-30</span>
                <span>Visiting *rabbis were often given opportunities to teach; but Nazareth, a village of sixteen hundred to two thousand inhabitants, already knew Jesus and would be less open to thinking about him in new ways. IVP Background Commentary</span>

                <span>LUK 4:32-32</span>
                <span>Most teachers would try to expound the *law by explaining the proper way to translate it or by appealing to their legal or *narrative traditions; Jesus goes beyond such practices. IVP Background Commentary</span>

                <span>LUK 5:12-16</span>
                <span>It was nearly impossible to find a place to be alone in ancient towns, with their narrow streets and sometimes (often in poorer places like Egypt) twenty people living in the common one-room houses. Most blocks in Capernaum consisted of four homes facing a common courtyard. Villages were also often close together, though one could find a place alone if one arose early enough (most people arose at dawn). IVP Background Commentary</span>

            <p>Certain numbers can have symbolic and other important meaning in cultures. There are many uses of numbers and measure in Scripture. Translating numbers without knowing their significance can miscommunicate the meaning, or lessen the impact of a Scripture passage. Scripture Use can be enhanced through appropriate use of numbering of Scripture products and their presentation. Knowledge of which numbers are good or bad can prevent miscommunication with the people around you.</p>
            <p>Look for recurring special numbers or counting patterns in oral tradition material such as stories, legends and folk tales; music and songs; the way people interpret dreams; material culture arrangements; games and gaming. Find out the symbolic significance of often repeated numbers.</p>

                <bold>Cereal Agriculture (OCM 243)</bold>
            </p>
            <p />
            <p>
                <bold>Description</bold>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The agricultural cycle is one way a society organizes its activities throughout the year. It involves the seasonal activities associated with the production of food crops in a particular locale. Whether families grow their own food, buy and barter for food grown by others, or do both, the agricultural cycle plays a key role in the formation of any society and its culture.</li>
                <li>learn language and cultural patterns essential to your own adjustment to the basic rhythms of life and work in the locale.</li>
                <li>understand matters of basic importance to your neighbors: what they eat and how they obtain it.</li>
                <li>build a fund of knowledge in preparation for translating the many passages where there is literal or figurative use of agricultural themes in Scripture.</li>
                <li>Some scholars have suggested that “rubbing with their hands” (v.1) by extension constituted threshing, a forbidden category of work on the sabbath. Although the law of Moses was especially authoritative for Jewish legal experts, the *narratives of other parts of the *Old Testament sometimes illustrate principles of the *law's spirit taking precedence over its normal practice (e.g., 2 Chron 30:2-3). If Jesus could demonstrate his case from Scripture, his opponents technically could not prosecute him successfully, due to the variety of Palestinian Jewish views on how the sabbath was to be observed. IVP Background Commentary</li>
                <li>One needed to keep one's eyes on the path of the plow to keep its furrow from becoming crooked. The hand-held plow was light and wooden and often had an iron point. When Elijah found Elisha plowing, he called him to follow but allowed him first to bid farewell to his family (1 Kings 19:19-21). Jesus' call here is more radical than that of a radical prophet. IVP Background Commentary</li>
                <li>Study the agricultural cycle in your location by observing and recording the seasons of the year and their typical weather patterns, and what crops grow in what season.</li>
                <li>Ask about the different work phases and requirements (burning, tilling, weeding, etc.) and the division of labor and composition of work groups (who does what part of the work)</li>
                <li>Learn the terms used for the seasons and their associated activities.</li>

                <bold>Description</bold>
            </p>
            <p>Burial, or cremation funeral practices vary from culture to culture.  They are important riturals for families and communities.  Because they often contain prescribed practices of things the family should do, they are times of intense family and social pressure. They are also times of crisis and transition and as such require family and / or comunity cooperation to honor and care for the desceased. </p>

                <span>Interrupting a funeral was a blatant breach of Jewish law and custom; touching the bier exposed Jesus to a day's uncleanness (Num 19:21-22); touching the corpse exposed him to a week's uncleanness (cf. Num 5:2-3; 19:11-20). But in Jesus' case, the influence goes in the other direction. (from IVP Biblical Background Commentary NT)</span>

                <span>LUK 7:11-17</span>
                <span>People customarily dropped whatever they were doing and joined in a funeral procession when it passed by. For a widow's only son to die before she did was considered extremely tragic; it also left her dependent on public charity for support unless she had other relatives of means. (from IVP Biblical Background Commentary NT)</span>

                <span>LUK 7:11-17</span>
                <span> According to custom the bereaved mother would walk in front of the bier, so Jesus would meet her first. Philosophers often tried to console the bereaved by saying, “Do not grieve, for it will do no good.” Jesus' approach is entirely different: he removes the cause of bereavement (1 Kings 17:17-24).v(from IVP Biblical Background Commentary NT)</span>

                <span>LUK 7:11-17</span>
                <span>By touching even the bier, a stretcher on which the body was borne (Jewish custom did not use a closed coffin), Jesus would contract corpse-uncleanness, the severest form of ritual impurity in Judaism. Only those closest to the deceased were expected to expose themselves to this impurity. The young man had not been dead long, because it was necessary to wash, anoint, wrap, mourn over and then bury the body as quickly as possible to avoid the stench of decomposition.(from IVP Biblical Background Commentary NT)</span>
            </p>
            <p class="scrtext">
                <span>LUK 9:57-62</span>
                <span>God had used several earlier prophets (Elijah and Elisha) to resuscitate the dead, but it was a rare miracle. The few pagan stories of resuscitations, especially from the third century A.D. (from Philostratus and *Apuleius), are later and not validated by eyewitnesses as the Gospel accounts are; they also often exhibit features missing here, such as reports from the underworld.

                <span>LUK 8:46-48</span>
                <span>Jewish people generally believed that only teachers closest to God had supernatural knowledge. Jesus uses his supernatural knowledge to identify with the woman who had touched him—even though in the eyes of the public this would mean that he had contracted ritual uncleanness. Lest anyone be permitted to think that the healing had been accomplished by typical pagan magic, operating without Jesus' knowledge, he declares that it happened in response to “faith” (v. 48).

                <span>Once an event had occurred, it was too late to pray for its reversal. For example, the *rabbis claimed that it was too late for one hearing a funeral procession to pray that it was not for a relative. (from IVP Biblical Background Commentary NT)</span>

                <span>Several professional mourners were required at the funeral of even the poorest person; the funeral for a member of a prominent family like this one would have many mourners. Because bodies decomposed rapidly in Palestine, mourners had to be assembled as quickly as possible, and they had gathered before word even reached Jairus that his daughter had died.

                <span>LUK 9:59-60</span>
                <span>Family members would not be outside talking with *rabbis during the mourning period, the week immediately following the death. The initial burial took place shortly after a person's decease, and would have already occurred by the time this man would be speaking with Jesus. But a year after the first burial, after the flesh had rotted off the bones, the son would return to rebury the bones in a special box in a slot in the tomb wall. Thus the son here could be asking for as much as a year's delay. One of an eldest son's most important responsibilities was his father's burial. Jesus' demand that the son place Jesus above this responsibility would thus sound like heresy: in Jewish tradition, honoring father and mother was one of the greatest commandments, and to follow Jesus in such a radical way would seem to break this commandment.

                <span>LUK 16:22-23</span>
                <span>Jewish lore often speaks of the righteous being carried away by angels; Jesus spares his hearers the traditional corresponding image of the wicked being carried away by demons. Every person, no matter how poor, was to receive a burial, and not to be buried was seen as terrible (e.g., 1 Kings 14:13). But Lazarus, having neither relatives nor charitable *patron, did not receive one, whereas the rich man would have received great eulogies. True Israelites and especially martyrs were expected to share with Abraham in the world to come. The most honored seat in a banquet would be nearest the host, reclining in such a way that one's head was near his bosom. IVP Background Commentary</span>

                <span>The punishment of “cutting in pieces” is attested elsewhere in an earlier period in the pagan Greek East; Luke's readers, who would view themselves as more civilized, would no doubt find this detail horrifying. Taken literally, the subsequent banishment with unbelievers could mean that he was deprived of decent burial; but in the *parable it especially points to the Jewish doctrine of hell (*Gehinnom) for idolaters.

                <span>Condemned criminals did not normally receive such honorable burials; but exceptions seem to have been made on the intercession of well-to-do family or friends, as the skeleton of a crucified man buried in another aristocratic Jewish tomb of this period testifies.

                <span>Because bodies decomposed rapidly, mourners were allowed to anoint, wash and wrap the body in its shrouds even on the sabbath. More elaborate arrangements that these loyal women *disciples wish to bestow on Jesus, however, might wait until the sabbath (sundown Friday evening to sundown Saturday evening) has passed.

                <li>The easiest way to research burial / creamation funeral practices in your area is create a case study.  Start building the case study by attended a funeral and then asking someone in the community to tell you a story about a death in the community, or about a funeral that they attended. Ask them to describe:</li>
                <li>Who all is involved in the process?</li>
                <li>What happens to the body?</li>
                <li>What are the responsibilities of the deceased family? What do they do?</li>
                <li>How long does all of this take?  What is the timeline of the event?</li>
                <li>What actions show respect / disrespect toward the deceased (and his family)</li>
                <li>What locations are important in the story?</li>
                <li>Are there any differences between a poor and rich man's funeral?</li>

            </p>
            <p>The weather is often a source of ideas and beliefs (especially about cause and effect). A group of people often share beliefs about the weather as part of their common cognitive culture, about weather phenomena, the seasonal round and climate, the earth, sun, moon, stars, eclipses and other unusual events, and the larger cosmos</p>
            <p>There are many references throughout the Scripture to weather. And there is probably no society where this is not a topic of great interest. Some of the ethno-meteorological references in Scripture are found in</p>

                <span>Some ancient stories told of powerful individuals able to subdue even the forces of nature, but these were nearly always gods or, less commonly, heroes of the distant past. In Jewish tradition, the one who ruled the winds and sea was God himself (Ps 107:29), though a few pious men were reputed to be able to persuade him to send rain. The surprise of the *disciples at Jesus' power is thus easy to understand. Storms often rose suddenly on the lake called the Sea of Galilee; these fishermen had usually stayed closer to Capernaum and are unprepared for a squall this far from shore. The only place one could sleep in a small fishing boat with water pouring in from a storm would be on the elevated stern, where one could use the wooden or leather-covered helmsman's seat, or a pillow sometimes kept under that seat, as a cushion to rest one's head.</span>

                <bold>Clothing (OCM 290)</bold>
            </p>
            <p>
                <bold>Description</bold>
            </p>
            <p>Clothing involes the garmets and materials used to cover the body for utility, warmth and ornamentation.</p>
            <p>There are many general references in Scripture to clothing: garments, fine clothes, expensive clothes, as well as many references to particular items: tunic, robe, cloak, belt, sandals.</p>
            <p>Although clothing is first of all an everyday functional item of material culture, it carries a significant load of meaning for humans in all cultures, and so also in Scripture, where there are many, many references to clothing. Three types of usage regarding clothing in Scripture are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Literal: There are terms for specific items and types of clothing, their use, manufacture and repair, used descriptively without figurative or symbolic intent. When the angel tells Peter in prison to put on his cloak and sandals, it means just that. It is not figurative or symbolic.</li>
                <li>Figurative: There are clothing terms used figuratively or metaphorically. The Bible’s figurative language may turn out to work well in a receptor language, even though the hearers initially perceive it as odd or unconventional. For example, the expression “you are clothed with splendour” in Psalm 104 requires an inititial leap of imagination to make sense.</li>
                <li>Symbolic: There are clothing terms used to stand for larger truths or meanings. They may use such features as colors, the actions of putting on, taking off, and changing clothes, and the symbolic opposition, clothed vs. naked. Clothing is used symbolically in themes running from Genesis to Revelation, from the skin garments of Adam and Eve to the white robes of the saints.</li>

                <span>Jesus uses two familiar facts to make his point. Older clothes had already shrunk from washing. Wine could be kept in either jars or wineskins; wineskins, unlike jars, would stretch. Old wineskins had already been stretched to capacity by wine fermenting within them; if they were then filled with unfermented wine, it would likewise expand, and the old wineskins, already stretched to the limit, would break. Watered-down wine was drunk with meals. IVP Bible Background Commentary</span>

                <bold>Research Suggestions</bold>
            </p>
            <p>Study background information on clothing; also think about clothing in your own culture. The use of clothing in some form, even the bare minimum, is an important human universal. Find material on these topics</p>
            <ul>
                <li>People use clothing for both practical and symbolic purposes. For example, A Christian priest wears a special collar to indicate his position and role in society. It is not just to keep his neck warm.</li>
                <li>They use it for warmth, for protection, to show modesty, ethnic identity, social status, or a spiritual condition. Men in the west wear 3 piece suits to indicate their seriousness as professionals. On the other hand, Information Technology professionals often wear jeans to show their profession. Many Muslim women wear a head covering for modesty as well as protection from harassment by men in public places.</li>
                <li>People may also choose their clothing in order to signal a break with their cultural traditions or social conventions. For example, some immigrants choose to wear the clothing styles of their adopted country rather than maintain their traditional clothing.</li>
                <li>Many culture-origin myths include accounts of how people came to wear clothing. What does genesis say? What are some other accounts of the origin of clothing?</li>
                <li>Language related to clothing can reflect all these factors and have sociolinguistic implications as well.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note and record:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>what items people wear</li>
                <li>men, women, boys, girls, adults, children, infants,</li>
                <li>what people of different statuses and roles wear</li>
                <li>elders, widows, richer/poorer, leaders, outsiders</li>
                <li>what people wear at life cycle changes/ceremonies, such as</li>
                <li>weddings, funerals, baptisms, initiations</li>
                <li>manufacture and care of clothes</li>

Is 7:10-14) asked for signs in the face of astounding promises, but they were not punished. That Zechariah's sign should be harsher to him (1:20) suggests only that this revelation is much greater than those which preceded it. IVP Background Commentary</span>

                <span>Casting incense on the heated altar of incense normally took little time, after which the priest emerged immediately. The delay here may have troubled the crowds; perhaps they thought Zechariah had been disrespectful and struck dead, or that something else had gone wrong.

                <span>"Like dancing, leaping was an expression of joy (e.g., Wisdom of Solomon 19:9). Jewish people recognized that the fetus was able to sense and respond to stimuli; while occasionally suggesting that the fetus's gender could be changed by prayer up until birth, some *rabbinic tradition also believed that infants could sin, sing and so forth in the womb. Some pagan stories also told of babies dancing in their mother's wombs or speaking in infancy, but pagans generally regarded these events as evil omens; here John's activity is instead a result of his prenatal sensitivity to the prophetic Spirit."

                <span>“Good news” could refer to the proclamation of God's salvation (Is 52:7), but pagans applied it also to celebrations of the cult of the emperor among all people in the supposedly worldwide empire. Particularly in celebration of his birthday (pagans publicly celebrated deities' birthdays), the emperor was hailed “Savior” and “Lord.” But Jesus' birth in a lowly manger distinguishes the true king from the Roman emperor, whose loyalists in Luke's day would have bristled at (and perhaps responded violently to) the implicit comparison. “Signs” are common in prophetic literature (e.g., Is 7:14; Ezek 12:11) and function as much to provoke and explain truth as to prove it.

                <span>This choir contrasts with the earthly choirs used in the worship of the emperor. The current emperor, Augustus, was praised for having inaugurated a worldwide peace. The inverted parallelism (God vs. people, and “in the highest” vs. “on earth”) suggests that “in the highest” means “among heaven's angelic hosts.” IVP Background Commentary</span>

                <span>LUK 2:25-26</span>
                <span>This encounter with Simeon no doubt occurs in the Court of Women. God's future intervention for Israel was described as “consolation” or “comfort” (cf., e.g., Is 49:13; 51:3; 52:9; 66:13). The “*Holy Spirit” was especially associated with *prophecy. On living to see God's *grace before dying, cf. Psalm 91:16, Tobit 10:13 and 11:9; sometimes in the Old Testament the righteous would be spared seeing disaster and the wicked would not experience good (e.g., 2 Kings 6:2; 22:20).</span>

                <span>LUK 2:33-25</span>
                <span>Prophecies in Jewish and Greco-Roman tradition were often obscure, easier understood in hindsight than at the moment they were given. Simeon's words probably allude to the stumbling stone of Isaiah 8:14-15 and the anticipated *resurrection. The “sword” reflects either Mary suffering over Jesus' pain or her heart being bared, probably the former (a mother's grief can symbolize a son's suffering, e.g., Judg 5:28).

                <span>Although the Old Testament did include prophetesses, they were much less prominent than male prophets in the Jewish tradition of this period. The name “Anna” (Tobit 1:9) is the Hebrew name “Hannah” (1 Sam 1:2).</span>

            <p class="scrtext">
                <span>LUK 2:37-38</span>
                <span>Jewish and Greco-Roman culture often viewed widows who never remarried as pious and faithful. Judith, a famous widow in Jewish tradition, was said to have lived as a widow till her death at 105. If one adds the two numbers given in the text here, seven and eighty-four (taking eighty-four as the length of Anna's widowhood rather than her age), and she was married at the common age of fourteen, one could see her as 105 also.

                <span>Slaves of high-status individuals often had higher status than free persons. A slave (unlike a *disciple, who also served a master) carried the master's sandals; John here claims that he is not worthy even to be Christ's slave. The prophets had predicted the outpouring of God's *Spirit on the righteous at the time when God established his *kingdom for Israel (Is 44:3; Ezek 39:29; Joel 2:28). They also decreed fire upon the wicked (Is 26:11; 65:15; 66:24; Jer 4:4; 15:14; etc.). In Matthew 3:11, the wicked are baptized, or immersed, in fire (3:10, 12), the righteous in the *Holy Spirit.

                <span>The *Old Testament prophets had declared that in the end time the righteous would be endowed with the *Holy Spirit and that the wicked would be burned with fire. The Jewish people generally viewed the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of *prophecy, and some circles viewed the Spirit as a force that purified God's people from unholiness.

                <span>John's preaching to Herod Antipas fits prophetic morality, but Herod and his advisers may view it as a political statement, especially given the political cost of Herod's illicit liaison with Herodias (see comment on Mk 6:17-20). Herod's nemesis, a Nabatean king, also found ethnic allies in Herod's subject territory of Perea, and Herod may have viewed John's preaching in that region (Jn 3:23) as especially damaging. In ancient Israel prophets normally enjoyed an immunity from persecution that was virtually unparalleled in the ancient Near East (prophets of other nations rarely denounced living kings; at most they suggested more funds for their temples). But some Israelite rulers did imprison (1 Kings 22:26-27; Jer 37—38) and seek to kill or silence them (1 Kings 13:4; 18:13; 19:2; 2 Kings 1:9; 6:31; 2 Chron 24:21; Jer 18:18, 23; 26:11, 20-23). John's costly stand prefigures Jesus' death at the hands of the authorities.</span>

                <span> The possessed person's lack of control over his own motor responses parallels examples of spirit possession in many cultures through history and is attested in anthropological studies of spirit possession today. Greek medical texts mention “foam” in connection with epileptic seizures, the symptoms of which are in this case (but not always—Mt 4:24) caused by demonic possession.

                <span>Jesus is revealing that the prophecy he just read has happened. "Immediacy (“today”; cf. 2:11; 19:5, 9; 23:43) is the initial key to the coming offense; the text Jesus reads is supposed to be fulfilled in the messianic era, and the inhabitants of Nazareth saw neither *Messiah nor messianic era before them. Because they lived only four miles from Sepphoris, they were well aware of how the Romans had destroyed that Galilean capital after a messianic-style revolt in A.D. 6; that this region was thereafter cautious about messianic announcements is clear from the fact that the rebuilt Sepphoris did not join in the later revolt of A.D. 66. Writers of the *Dead Sea Scrolls, who believed that they lived on the verge of the end time, often stressed the immediacy of biblical *prophecies, applying descriptions of Nahum, Habakkuk and others to their own day. Interpreting the Bible this way was thus not in itself offensive to first-century Palestinian Jews; the offense was implying that the end time had arrived in Jesus' own ministry."

            <p>One way to find out about revelation is to ask people to tell you about situation where reveleation happened. How did it happen? Who initiated it? Where did it come from?
