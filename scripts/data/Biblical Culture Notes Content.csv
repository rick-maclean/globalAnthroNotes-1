,152 Desires and emotions,2 Description,1,,"Everyone has desires and emotions, and how these get expressed depends on how the people around us express them. Emotions are universal, expression of emotions is cultural. Some cultures encourage people to curse when they are angry, other cultures tell people to not show any anger at all, but to get revenge later. Even the word used to express pain is different. In English people often say ‘ouch’. In French they say ‘oi’.",

Laughing at someone can be either a way to make fun of them, or it can be a way to relieve tension when something unusual or embarrassing happens.

It was a means of social solidarity and sharing with the whole group the blessings from God to his people (DEU 24:19-20).",
RUT 3:1-5,243 Grain agriculture,3 Application to biblical source,1,,"After the grain was cut it was taken to the threshing floor, an open space near the fields where rocks have been removed and the ground made hard. Often the threshing floor was slightly elevated above the level of the fields to take advantage of wind for winnowing. The grain was threshed by laying it out on the threshing floor and beating it or having a donkey walk on it. This caused the outer covering of the grain to break open. After threshing, the grain was winnowed, that is, separated from the chaff (the broken outer coating and straw) by tossing it into the air with specially made tools. The grain was then stored separately from the straw.","IVP

,290 Clothing and decoration,2 Description,3,3,"Symbolic: There are clothing terms used to stand for larger truths or meanings.

,675 Agreements and promises,2 Description,2,,"In Scripture, oaths are a common form of making promises. They emphasize the promise that is being made. Ruth swears she won’t leave Naomi to show how strongly she feels about staying with her (RUT 1:17). Another form of promise in scripture is called a covenant. These were made between governments of two countries, where one country was stronger than the other. The weaker country usually agreed to be a vassal or subject to the stronger nation and pay them tribute. The stronger nation promised to help if the weaker nation got in a war with some other nation. The agreement between the countries was written down, listing all the responsibilities of each side. God of Israel made covenants with both the nation and with individuals, with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.",
